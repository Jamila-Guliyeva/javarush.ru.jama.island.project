This application represents the Island model with different kind oh inhabitants. All the inhabitants are split into
three groups: predators (Bear, Boa, Eagle, Fox, Wolf), herbivores (Boar, Buffalo, Caterpillar, Deer, Duck, Goat,
Horse, Mouse, Rabbit, Sheep) and plants.

The island model includes a number of locations (cells), each sell has it's own inhabitants.
While start of the program each cell gets the random number of random types of inhabitants.
After each tact following actions are took place:
 - all animals try to eat (if the current location has any food of them);
 - all animals try to breed (in case if the location has the same type of animal);
 - all animals (survived) try to move (sometimes they stay at the same location if "Random speed value" is 0);

 Animals and plants could be eaten, animals could die of hunger (in case if the current Cell doesn't contain any
 type of objects which could be considered as food).

 After each tact we get the Statistics Report, which represents the data about current number of Island inhabitants -
 "The icon of inhabitant" - "Current number of inhabitants".
